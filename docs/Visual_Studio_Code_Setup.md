# Using VS Code For Development

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a functional free IDE which can be used to develop many projects. Through the use of Docker images it allows developers to develop in containers where build tools can be preconfigured, precluding the need to have a special host to build on with instructions to follow for tool installation.  It can be used on Windows hosts using Docker Desktop or on Linux hosts with Docker installed.

## General Setup

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers as a reference on setting up your environment.  Here is a summary of the steps:
* Install Docker
* Install VS Code
* Open the source folder on your host.  VS Code should notifiy you that there are extensions available to handle the .devcontainer folder.

## Other setup

* Secrets files
