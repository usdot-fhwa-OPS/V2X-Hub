# Kowl considers config options from three sources:
# Flags, YAML config and env variables - in that order.
# Accordingly env variables and YAML configs can overwrite input
# that is set via flags.
#
# --- YAML
# If you want to configure Kowl using a YAML file, specify the path
# either by setting the flag -config.filepath or by providing
# the path via the env variable CONFIG_FILEPATH.
#
# --- Env variables
# All config options can be configured via environment variables
# as well.
# Env variables that expect array values can be provided by providing
# a comma separated string ("kafka-0:9092,kafka-1:9092").
# The env variable name is auto generated by upper casing the YAML
# equivalent and adding an underscore for each indentation/level.
#
# Some examples:
# kafka.rackId => KAFKA_RACKID
# kafka.tls.caFilepath => KAFKA_TLS_CAFILEPATH
#
# --- Note
# Commented config settings are optional and show the defaults
